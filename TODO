//// TODO:

== Add README

== Refactor
- Make a collection for this

== Feature
? Runtime typing as needed
- Work in file positions to errors

== Fix
- Unify function and general ids
? Fix the type-checking of function arguments

//// Done:

== Refactor
- Change all names to represent the fact that macros are actually functions
- Rework the handling of types
- Rework errors to use exceptions/to be cleaner
- Replace various stacks with parameters
- Move def-table into its own file and make accessor functions
- Instead of do-everything-in-one-fell-swoop, create different passes
  - Possibly splitting them into their own files.
- Make run-prog/exp nicer
- Change pseudo-asm model to use one stack, for simplicity's sake
  - To that end, have (conceptually) one push op and one pop op

== Feature
- Make function/macro marks less generic
- Create a unit signature for backends to import so they know they have everything needed
  implemented.

== Fix
! Change pseudo-assembly to create and call functions a la x86 instead of explicitly pushing
  return addresses.
- Change exp-rep-arg to work with list of registers correctly
! Segfault with assembly backend
